    <br>- Noise-aware weakly supervised Training with weakly generated labeled data
    <br>- Fine-tuning with small strongly labeled data generated by an expert"

  description: "(In-prepration) In this study, we demonstrate a way to generate training data in the presence of a
search interface and a limited annotation budget. The proposed algorithm suggests
an effective set of queries about a topic of interest to submit to the search interface.
The output data is labeled and used to train the document classification algorithm."
